  <h2>More Information on Scientists discover new exoplanet</h2>
  <img src="WhatsApp Image 2023-03-24 at 1.31.07 AM.jpeg" alt="Mars">
  <p>A team of astronomers have discovered a new exoplanet that is similar in size and composition to Earth. The planet, named Proxima Centauri b, is located in the habitable zone of its star, and may be able to support life.</p>
  <p>
  roxima Centauri b is an exoplanet located in the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, which is the closest star to our own sun. The planet was discovered in August 2016 using the radial velocity method, which detects the wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.

Proxima Centauri b is estimated to be about 1.17 times the mass of Earth, with a radius only slightly larger than our planet's. Its orbital period is just 11.2 Earth days, and it is located at a distance of 0.05 astronomical units (AU) from its star. This puts it in the habitable zone, which is the region around a star where the temperature is just right for liquid water to exist on the surface of a planet.

The discovery of Proxima Centauri b generated a lot of excitement in the scientific community, as it is the closest potentially habitable exoplanet to Earth. However, there are still many unknowns about the planet, including its atmosphere, magnetic field, and whether it has water on its surface.

Additionally, the star Proxima Centauri is known to be a flare star, which means that it is prone to sudden and intense bursts of energy that could be harmful to any life on Proxima Centauri b. Nonetheless, the discovery of this exoplanet has sparked interest in the search for potentially habitable planets around other nearby stars, and has reinvigorated efforts to study the potential for life beyond our solar system.
