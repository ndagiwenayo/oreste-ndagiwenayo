  <h2>More Information on NASA launches new mission to study the sun</h2>
  <img src="WhatsApp Image 2023-03-24 at 1.37.03 AM (2).jpeg" alt="Mars">
  <p>NASA has launched a new spacecraft, called Solar Probe Plus, to study the sun up close. The mission will provide valuable information about the sun's atmosphere and help scientists understand the solar wind, which can have an impact on Earth's magnetic field and climate.</p>
  <p>
  The Solar Probe Plus mission, which was launched by NASA in August 2018, is designed to study the sun up close and provide valuable data about the solar wind and the sun's atmosphere, or corona. The spacecraft will travel closer to the sun than any previous mission, and will fly through the corona, where temperatures can reach up to 3 million degrees Fahrenheit.

The mission is expected to provide new insights into the workings of the sun and the processes that drive its behavior. Specifically, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles that flows from the sun and can have an impact on Earth's magnetic field and climate. By studying the solar wind up close, the Solar Probe Plus mission may help scientists predict and prepare for the effects of solar storms on Earth.

The Solar Probe Plus spacecraft is equipped with a suite of instruments to measure the magnetic and electric fields, plasma waves, and charged particles in the sun's atmosphere. The spacecraft will also use a heat shield made of a carbon composite material to protect itself from the intense heat and radiation of the sun.

The mission is expected to last for seven years, during which time the spacecraft will make 24 orbits around the sun. Each orbit will bring the spacecraft closer to the sun, with the final orbit taking it within 3.9 million miles of the sun's surface.

Overall, the Solar Probe Plus mission represents a major step forward in our understanding of the sun and its impact on the solar system. The data collected by the mission may have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the origins and evolution of the solar system, as well as the broader field of space weather research.
