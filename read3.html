  <h2>More Information on how China becomes first country to land on the far side of the moon</h2>

  <p>China's Chang'e-4 spacecraft has successfully landed on the far side of the moon, becoming the first country to do so. The mission will explore the uncharted terrain on the far side of the moon and conduct experiments on the lunar surface.</p>
  <p>
  China's Chang'e-4 spacecraft successfully landed on the far side of the moon on January 3, 2019, making China the first country to land a spacecraft on the far side of the moon. The mission is named after the Chinese moon goddess and is part of China's ambitious space program.

The far side of the moon is the side of the moon that always faces away from Earth, and it is relatively unexplored compared to the near side of the moon. The Chang'e-4 mission is designed to study the geology and terrain of the far side of the moon, and to conduct experiments on the lunar surface.

The spacecraft consists of a lander and a rover, which will explore the lunar surface for several months. The lander is equipped with a variety of scientific instruments, including cameras, a spectrometer, and a low-frequency radio detector. The rover is designed to move across the lunar surface, collect samples, and analyze the geology of the area.

One of the key objectives of the mission is to study the composition of the moon's crust on the far side, which is expected to be different from the near side due to the moon's history and formation. The mission will also study the lunar surface temperature, the distribution of lunar soil, and the impact of cosmic radiation on the lunar surface.

The Chang'e-4 mission is a significant milestone for China's space program and for space exploration in general. It represents a major step forward in our understanding of the moon and its geological history, and it could lead to new discoveries and insights into the origins and evolution of the solar system.
